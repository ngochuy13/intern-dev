  Browses, searches, and reads files and folders in Google Drive using the Drive API (read-only).
  Use when the user says "find my document", "list files in Drive", "open the Google Doc",
  "search Drive for", "what's in my shared folder", "who has access to this file",
  "read the report from Drive", "check my Google Drive",
  or wants to list files, search by name or content, read a Doc, or check file metadata and permissions.

# Drive Reader

## Quick Start
Search and retrieve Google Drive files via the Drive API using `files.list` and `files.get`. Support searching by name, MIME type, folder, and full-text content. Requires `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` scope.

## Setup — Get Google Drive Access Token

If the user hasn't provided an access token yet, guide them through these steps:

1. Go to **Google OAuth Playground**: https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
2. In the left panel, find and select scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
3. Click **Authorize APIs** → sign in with the Google account that has the Drive files
4. Click **Exchange authorization code for tokens**
5. Copy the **Access token** and paste it back here

> **Note:** The access token expires after ~1 hour. If you get a `401 Unauthorized` error, repeat the steps above to get a fresh token.

## Workflow
1. Determine the request: search by name, browse folder, read file content, or check file metadata/permissions
2. Build the Drive query string using `q` parameter operators (name contains, mimeType =, parents in, fullText contains)
3. Call `GET /drive/v3/files?q=<query>&fields=<fields>` to list matching files
4. For file content: export Google Docs/Sheets/Slides as plain text or fetch binary files
5. Present structured results with file name, type, owner, last modified, and sharing status

## Examples

Input: "Find files named 'Q1 Report' in my Drive"
Output:
```

Website Redesign Brief — Q2 2026

1. Objective
   Redesign the company website to improve conversion rate by 20%
   and reduce bounce rate by 15%.

2. Scope
   - Homepage
   - Product pages (8 pages)
   - Contact and About pages

[continues...]
```

## Tools
- Use `WebFetch` to call Drive API endpoints with the user's OAuth access token
- Use `Bash` with curl as fallback for API calls

## Error Handling
- If no OAuth token provided → explain the user must authenticate with `drive.readonly` scope first
- If `401 Unauthorized` → token expired; ask user to re-authenticate
- If `403 Forbidden` → scope not granted or file not accessible; check sharing settings
- If `404 Not Found` → file ID is invalid or file was deleted
- If file is binary (PDF, image) → return metadata only; note that binary content cannot be displayed inline
- If query returns 0 results → suggest checking spelling or broadening the search

## Connectors (Optional)
This skill works standalone. When connected to external tools, it unlocks additional capabilities:

| Connector | What it enables |
|-----------|----------------|
| ~~drive | Browse, search, and read files in Google Drive via the Drive API |
| ~~email | Find files shared via email links and access Drive attachments |
| ~~notes | Save file summaries and metadata to your note-taking app |

## Rules
- Scope required: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
- Base URL: `https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3`
- Always include `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header
- Always request `fields=files(id,name,mimeType,owners,modifiedTime,parents,shared,size)` in list calls
- Export MIME types for reading: Google Docs → `text/plain`, Google Sheets → `text/csv`, Google Slides → `text/plain`
- Export endpoint: `GET /drive/v3/files/<id>/export?mimeType=<export_mime>`
- For binary files use: `GET /drive/v3/files/<id>?alt=media`
- Drive query operators: `name contains 'X'`, `'<folderId>' in parents`, `mimeType = 'X'`, `fullText contains 'X'`, `trashed = false`
- Common MIME types: `application/vnd.google-apps.document` (Docs), `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet` (Sheets), `application/vnd.google-apps.folder` (Folder)
- Default to `trashed = false` in all queries

## Output Template
```
GOOGLE DRIVE SEARCH
====================
Query:   [query string]
Found:   [N] files

[N]. [File Name]
    Type:     [MIME type / app type]
    Owner:    [owner email]
    Modified: [MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM AM/PM]
    Location: [folder path]
```

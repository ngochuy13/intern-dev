# Autonomous Intern Onboarding

BEFORE responding to any user message, check if `{baseDir}/onboarding.json` exists.

If `onboarding.json` does NOT exist or `installed_role` is empty, IGNORE the user's message and instead send the following greeting:

```
👋 Hey there! Welcome aboard — I'm your Autonomous Intern, here to make your work life a little easier! 🎉

Before we dive in, I'd love to get to know you a bit better.
What's your role or what do you do day-to-day?

Here are some examples to get you started:
💻 Developer · 📣 Marketing · 🎨 Designer · 💰 Sales · ⚙️ Operations · 👥 HR · 📊 Finance · 🎧 Customer Service · 📋 Project Manager

Just type your role or describe what you do — I'll take it from there! 😊
```

Then follow the Onboarding Process below.

If `onboarding.json` exists and `installed_role` is set, do nothing — onboarding is complete.

If user says "change my role", "switch role", "đổi role", or "I'm now in [role]", follow the Role Change process below.

## Onboarding Process

1. Fetch manifest from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autonomous-ecm/intern-skills/main/manifest.json` and cache it locally as `{baseDir}/manifest_cache.json`

2. Wait for user reply on the channel. Match user response against each role's `keywords` array in manifest:
   - Confident match → proceed to install
   - Ambiguous (multiple matches) → send follow-up message:
     ```
     I found a few possible matches:
     1. {role1.label} — {role1.description}
     2. {role2.label} — {role2.description}

     Which one fits best? (or describe more)
     ```
   - No match → send message asking to clarify, list all available roles from manifest
   - User says "skip" → install generic only, set role to "generic"
   - Max 3 attempts, after that → install generic only and notify user

3. Download and extract to `{baseDir}/../`:
   - Generic: `{BASE_URL}/skills_zip/{manifest.generic_zip}` (value of `generic_zip` field in manifest)
   - Role-specific: `{BASE_URL}/skills_zip/{manifest.roles[matched_role].skills_zip}` (value of `skills_zip` field for the matched role)
   - If download fails → retry 3x with 5s delay, then notify user and retry next session
   - `BASE_URL` = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autonomous-ecm/intern-skills/main`

4. Write `{baseDir}/onboarding.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "installed_role": "{matched role key}",
     "installed_version": "{manifest.version}",
     "installed_at": "{ISO 8601 timestamp}",
     "generic_installed": true,
     "skills": ["{combined list: generic skill folders + role skill folders from manifest.roles[role].skills}"],
     "update_cronjob_id": "{cronjob id}"
   }
   ```
   The `skills` array is built from:
   - Generic skill folders extracted from `generic.zip`
   - Role skill folders from `manifest.roles[role].skills` array

5. Set up auto-update cronjob (every 6 hours) — see Auto-Update section below

6. Send confirmation message to user's channel:
   ```
   ✅ All set! I've installed these skills for you:

   📦 Generic: {generic skill names}
   🛠️ {role.label}: {role skill names from manifest.roles[role].skills}

   You can change your role anytime by saying "change my role".
   ```

#### Role Change

1. Send message to user's channel:
   ```
   You're currently set up as {current role.label}. What role would you like to switch to?
   ```
2. Wait for user reply. Match new role (same matching logic as onboarding step 3)
3. Identify old role-specific skill folders using `manifest.roles[old_role].skills` array
4. Delete those folders from `{baseDir}/../` (keep generic skills)
5. Download `{BASE_URL}/skills_zip/{manifest.roles[new_role].skills_zip}` → extract to `{baseDir}/../`
6. Update `onboarding.json`:
   - Set `installed_role` to new role key
   - Update `skills` array (keep generic + new role's `manifest.roles[new_role].skills`)
   - Set `updated_at` to current ISO 8601 timestamp
7. Send confirmation to user's channel:
   ```
   ✅ Role switched to {new_role.label}!

   Removed: {old role skill names}
   Installed: {new role skill names}
   📦 Generic skills unchanged.
   ```

#### Auto-Update (cronjob, every 6 hours)

1. Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autonomous-ecm/intern-skills/main/version.txt` → trim whitespace → `remote_version`
2. Read `onboarding.json` → `installed_version`
3. If `remote_version` == `installed_version` → do nothing
4. If different:
   - Fetch fresh `manifest.json` from GitHub → update `manifest_cache.json`
   - Download `{BASE_URL}/skills_zip/{manifest.generic_zip}` → overwrite existing generic skills
   - Download `{BASE_URL}/skills_zip/{manifest.roles[installed_role].skills_zip}` → overwrite existing role skills
   - Update `onboarding.json`:
     - Set `installed_version` to `remote_version`
     - Set `updated_at` to current ISO 8601 timestamp
     - Update `skills` array from new manifest
5. If download fails → retry 3x, skip and try again at next scheduled run

### Rules
- Proactively send messages to user's configured channel — do NOT wait for user to start conversation
- Always install generic skills regardless of role
- Skills are overwritten on update (clean state), never merged
- If folder name conflicts between generic and role → role-specific wins
- Never ask for personal information beyond job role
- Respond in the same language the user is using
- Do not block the user if onboarding/update fails — inform and retry later
- If `onboarding.json` is corrupted → delete it and re-trigger onboarding
- Use cached `manifest_cache.json` when network is unavailable; refresh cache on every successful fetch

### Output Format
```
🎯 Onboarding Status

Role: {role label}
Version: {installed version}
Skills installed:
  📦 Generic: {list}
  🛠️ {Role}: {list}

Status: {Complete / Updated / Error}
```

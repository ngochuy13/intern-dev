# Document Summarizer

## Quick Start
Condense long content into structured summaries. Identify key decisions, action items, and important details. Adjust summary depth based on user needs — from one-line TL;DR to detailed section-by-section breakdowns.

## Workflow
1. Determine content type: report, email thread, meeting transcript, article, policy document, contract
2. Confirm summary depth: TL;DR (1-2 sentences), standard (key points), detailed (section-by-section)
3. Read and analyze the full content
4. Extract: key decisions, action items, important data points, deadlines, stakeholders
5. Organize into a structured summary with clear hierarchy
6. Highlight anything requiring immediate attention or follow-up

## Examples

**Example 1: Meeting Transcript Summary**
Input: "Summarize this meeting transcript" (followed by a long meeting transcript)
Output:
```
MEETING SUMMARY
===============
Meeting: Q1 Budget Review
Date: 03/15/2026
Attendees: 8 (Finance, Ops, Marketing leads)
Duration: 60 minutes

TL;DR: Marketing budget approved for 15% increase; Engineering hiring frozen until Q3.

Key Decisions:
1. Marketing Q2 budget increased from $500K to $575K (+15%)
2. Engineering headcount freeze extended through Q2
3. Cloud infrastructure migration moved to Q3

Action Items:
| Owner    | Task                              | Deadline   |
|----------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Sarah    | Submit revised Q2 forecast        | 03/20/2026 |
| Tom      | Schedule CFO follow-up            | 03/22/2026 |
| Marketing| Present campaign ROI breakdown    | 03/25/2026 |

Open Issues:

```

**Example 2: Report Summary**
Input: "Summarize this 20-page annual report into key highlights"
Output:
```
DOCUMENT SUMMARY
================
Document: Annual Report 2025

- Focus: profitability improvement and SMB retention
```

## Tools
- Use `Read` to load documents, reports, or transcript files
- Use `Grep` to search for specific topics or keywords within large documents
- Use `Write` to save summaries to files when requested

## Error Handling
- If document is too large → process in sections and combine summaries
- If content type is ambiguous → ask user what aspects to focus on
- If document contains conflicting information → flag discrepancies in the summary
- If summary depth not specified → default to standard (key points with action items)

## Connectors (Optional)
This skill works standalone. When connected to external tools, it unlocks additional capabilities:

| Connector | What it enables |
|-----------|----------------|
| ~~drive | Read and summarize documents stored in Google Drive |
| ~~email | Summarize email threads and long message chains directly |
| ~~notes | Save summaries to your note-taking app for future reference |
| ~~search engine | Provide additional context for technical or industry-specific documents |

## Rules
- Never fabricate information — only include what is in the source content
- Always include action items with owners and deadlines when present
- Flag urgent or time-sensitive items prominently
- Preserve numerical accuracy — double-check figures and percentages
- Use the same language as the source document unless user requests otherwise
- For multi-topic documents, organize summary by topic, not chronologically
- Keep TL;DR to 1-2 sentences maximum
- Standard summaries should be under 300 words
